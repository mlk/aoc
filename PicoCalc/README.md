# Clockwork PI PicoCalc

For the giggles I'm seeing how far I can get using a [ClockWork PI PicoCalc](https://www.clockworkpi.com/picocalc).
All code in this folder is written and run on a real device using the default [MMBasic](https://mmbasic.com/).

## WHY?!

I watched a video on an [HP 200lx](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HP_200LX) and was reminded of my old [Psion Revo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psion_Revo).
Alas my Revo is dead and replacements cost more than I was willing to spend.
I've now spent way more slowly building a collection of funky handhelds.

## Am I 100% On Device?
Unfortunately not. All development and running is on device, but I've not been able to get the device online. 
As such downloading the input, submitting results and committing to Git are all done on a PC.
