# CardPuter (ESP32)

For the giggles I'm seeing how far I can get using a [CardPuter](https://shop.m5stack.com/products/m5stack-cardputer-kit-w-m5stamps3).

## WHY?!

I watched a video on an [HP 200lx](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HP_200LX) and was reminded of my old [Psion Revo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psion_Revo). Alas my Revo is dead and replacements cost more than I was willing to spend. The Series 5 (the bigger, little brother) was an acceptable cost so I picked on up. I needed to justify the cost by doing *something* with it.

The [PSION folder](https://github.com/mlk/aoc/tree/main/PSION) was that something and it was great fun, so I picked up a HP 95LX, a Hand386 and now a CardPuter.

## Am I 100% On Device?

Unfortunately not. All development and running is on device, but I've not been able to get the device online. 
As such downloading the input, submitting results and committing to Git are all done on a PC. 

### What am I using

* The onboard editor with [MicroHydra](https://github.com/echo-lalia/Cardputer-MicroHydra). MicroHydra has made API changes. I do not plan on going back and fixing old solutions.
