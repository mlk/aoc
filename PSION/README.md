# Psion

For the giggles I'm seeing how far I can get using a [Psion Series 5](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psion_Series_5). All code in this folder is written and run on a real device using the built-in [Psion OPL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_Programming_Language).

## Device Specification

|.|.|
|-|-|
|**Release Year**|1997| 
|**CPU**| 18MHz ARM7100 RISC CPU|
|**Memory**|8MB (Shared with RAM Drive)|
|**Screen**|640x240|
|**OS**|EPOC32|
|**Exteral Storage**|128MB [CompactFlash](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CompactFlash)|

## File Format

The files are stored in the Psion's binary format, which is not very Git friendly. I've also pushed text versions of the files.

## WHY?!

I watched a video on an [HP 200lx](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HP_200LX) and was reminded of my old [Psion Revo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psion_Revo). Alas my Revo is dead and replacements cost more than I was willing to spend. The Series 5 (the bigger, little brother) was an acceptable cost so I picked on up. Now I need to justify the cost by doing *something* with it.

This is that something.

## Why are some files named partXaY

These are my second attempt when my interesting first attempt failed. As I found the first attempt interesting, I've left the file in the repository and included a short readme.

## Am I 100% On Device?
Unfortunately not. All development and running is on device, but I've not been able to get the device online. 
As such downloading the input, submitting results and committing to Git are all done on a PC.
